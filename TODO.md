- add a common TTL to each particle
  particles tend to group in a common path after the flow field starts being changed; to "reset" that condition,
  particles should die and new ones should replace them at random spots
- make particles flow nicely and not change direction abruptly like they're doing now
- rename project to 'flow field', since it's not about wind anymore, it seems
- increase flow field editing brush size
